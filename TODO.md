### 1. console version tasks
  [ ] - **Logs levels** : this ensures that user tell us which logs level want to see, he may not want to se info logs, may be want to se only warnings and errors or he may also want to not see warnings, just only errors wo wee will need to make customisation for user so that he can do it or even turn of the logger [reference](https://github.com/jonnyreeves/js-logger#usage)
